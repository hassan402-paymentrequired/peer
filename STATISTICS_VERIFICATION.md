# Statistics Mapping Verification - Based on README Sample

## âœ… Tournament Winners - TOP 3 FIXED

**Previous Issue**: Only selected participants with highest score (1st place ties)
**Fixed**: Now selects TOP 3 positions with proper tie handling

### Example Tournament Results:

```
Player A: 45 points â†’ 1st place âœ…
Player B: 45 points â†’ 1st place âœ… (tie)
Player C: 40 points â†’ 3rd place âœ…
Player D: 35 points â†’ 4th place (not winner)
Player E: 30 points â†’ 5th place (not winner)
```

**Winners**: Players A, B, C (top 3 positions)

## âœ… Statistics Mapping - VERIFIED CORRECT

### Sample Players from README:

#### 1. Antony (Scorer)

```json
API Response:
{
  "goals": { "total": 2, "assists": 0 },
  "shots": { "total": 3, "on": 2 },
  "cards": { "yellow": 0, "red": 0 },
  "games": { "minutes": 90, "position": "M" }
}

Database Mapping:
- goals_total: 2 âœ…
- goals_assists: 0 âœ…
- shots_total: 3 âœ…
- shots_on_target: 2 âœ…
- yellow_cards: 0 âœ…
- minutes: 90 âœ…
- position: "M" âœ…

Points Calculation: (2Ã—13) + (0Ã—7) + (3Ã—2) + (2Ã—1) = 34 points âœ…
```

#### 2. Pablo Fornals (Assist Provider)

```json
API Response:
{
  "goals": { "total": null, "assists": 2 },
  "shots": { "total": null, "on": null },
  "cards": { "yellow": 0, "red": 0 },
  "games": { "minutes": 90, "position": "M" }
}

Database Mapping:
- goals_total: 0 (null â†’ 0) âœ…
- goals_assists: 2 âœ…
- shots_total: 0 (null â†’ 0) âœ…
- shots_on_target: 0 (null â†’ 0) âœ…
- yellow_cards: 0 âœ…
- minutes: 90 âœ…

Points Calculation: (0Ã—13) + (2Ã—7) + (0Ã—2) + (0Ã—1) = 14 points âœ…
```

#### 3. Sofyan Amrabat (Yellow Card)

```json
API Response:
{
  "goals": { "total": null, "assists": 0 },
  "shots": { "total": null, "on": null },
  "cards": { "yellow": 1, "red": 0 },
  "games": { "minutes": 90, "position": "M" }
}

Database Mapping:
- goals_total: 0 (null â†’ 0) âœ…
- goals_assists: 0 âœ…
- shots_total: 0 (null â†’ 0) âœ…
- yellow_cards: 1 âœ…
- minutes: 90 âœ…

Points Calculation: (0Ã—13) + (0Ã—7) + (0Ã—2) + (0Ã—1) + (1Ã—-1) = -1 â†’ 0 points âœ…
(Points capped at minimum 0)
```

#### 4. Pau LÃ³pez (Goalkeeper)

```json
API Response:
{
  "goals": { "total": null, "conceded": 2, "saves": 2 },
  "games": { "minutes": 90, "position": "G" }
}

Database Mapping:
- goals_total: 0 (null â†’ 0) âœ…
- goals_conceded: 2 âœ…
- goals_saves: 2 âœ…
- minutes: 90 âœ…
- position: "G" âœ…

Points Calculation: (0Ã—13) + (0Ã—7) + (2Ã—3) = 6 points âœ…
(No clean sheet bonus - conceded 2 goals)
```

## âœ… Null Value Handling - IMPROVED

**Enhanced null handling** to explicitly check for null values:

```php
// Before: $goals['total'] ?? 0
// After: is_null($goals['total']) ? 0 : (int)$goals['total']
```

This ensures proper type casting and null handling for all numeric fields.

## âœ… Key Improvements Made:

1. **Tournament Winners**: Fixed to select TOP 3 positions instead of just 1st place
2. **Null Handling**: Enhanced null value handling with explicit type casting
3. **Point Calculation**: Verified correct with sample data
4. **Clean Sheet Logic**: Properly checks conceded goals and minutes played

## ðŸ§ª Test Cases Verified:

- âœ… Players with goals (Antony: 34 points)
- âœ… Players with assists (Pablo Fornals: 14 points)
- âœ… Players with yellow cards (Sofyan Amrabat: 0 points)
- âœ… Goalkeepers with saves (Pau LÃ³pez: 6 points)
- âœ… Null value handling across all fields
- âœ… Top 3 tournament winners selection

## ðŸš€ Ready for Production

Both tournament winner selection and statistics mapping are now correctly implemented and verified against your README sample data!
