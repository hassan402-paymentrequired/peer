# WebPush Notification Integration

## ✅ **Complete WebPush Integration**

I've integrated WebPush notifications into your existing NotificationService. Now when tournaments complete, peers finish, or prizes are won, users will receive both:

1. **In-app notifications** (stored in database)
2. **Browser push notifications** (WebPush)

## 🔔 **Notification Types Created**

### 1. Tournament Completed Notification

```php
// Sent when tournament finishes
new TournamentCompletedNotification(
    $tournamentName,
    $isWinner,
    $totalPoints,
    $prizeAmount
);
```

**WebPush Features:**

- 🏆 Trophy icon for winners
- 📊 Shows points and prize amount
- 🔗 Action button: "View Results"
- ⏰ 24-hour TTL

### 2. Peer Completed Notification

```php
// Sent when peer competition finishes
new PeerCompletedNotification(
    $peerName,
    $isWinner,
    $totalPoints,
    $winnerName,
    $prizeAmount
);
```

**WebPush Features:**

- 🎯 Peer competition icon
- 👤 Shows winner name
- 🔗 Action button: "View Results"

### 3. Prize Won Notification

```php
// Sent when user wins money
new PrizeWonNotification(
    $amount,
    $competitionType,
    $competitionName,
    $newBalance
);
```

**WebPush Features:**

- 🎉 Prize icon
- 💰 Shows amount won and new balance
- 🔗 Action button: "View Wallet"
- 📌 Requires interaction (stays visible)

## 🔧 **Enhanced Service Worker**

Updated `public/service-worker.js` with:

- ✅ Better notification handling
- ✅ Action button support
- ✅ Smart window/tab management
- ✅ Vibration patterns for mobile
- ✅ Notification tagging and timestamps

## 🛠️ **New Components Added**

### Files Created:

1. `app/Notifications/TournamentCompletedNotification.php`
2. `app/Notifications/PeerCompletedNotification.php`
3. `app/Notifications/PrizeWonNotification.php`
4. `app/Http/Controllers/PushSubscriptionController.php`

### Files Updated:

1. `app/Services/NotificationService.php` - Added WebPush sending
2. `public/service-worker.js` - Enhanced notification handling
3. `routes/web.php` - Added subscription saving route

## 🧪 **Testing**

### Test Routes Available:

```bash
POST /api/test/notification          # In-app notification
POST /api/test/tournament-notification # Tournament notification
POST /api/test/prize-notification    # Prize notification
POST /api/test/webpush-notification  # Direct WebPush test
```

### Test in Browser:

1. Visit your app (service worker registers automatically)
2. Grant notification permission
3. Call any test route
4. Should see both in-app and browser notifications

## 🚀 **How It Works**

### Tournament/Peer Completion Flow:

```
1. CalculateCompetitionScoresJob completes
2. NotificationService.notifyTournamentCompletion() called
3. For each participant:
   - Creates in-app notification (database)
   - Sends WebPush notification (browser)
4. User sees both notifications
```

### WebPush Delivery:

```
1. Laravel queues WebPush notification
2. Sends to browser via push service
3. Service worker receives push event
4. Shows native browser notification
5. User clicks → opens relevant page
```

## 📱 **Mobile Support**

- ✅ Works on mobile browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari)
- ✅ Vibration patterns for mobile devices
- ✅ Proper icon and badge display
- ✅ Action buttons work on mobile

## 🔒 **Security**

- ✅ Uses VAPID keys for authentication
- ✅ Subscription endpoint validation
- ✅ User authentication required
- ✅ CSRF protection on routes

## 🎯 **Ready for Production**

Your WebPush integration is complete! Users will now receive rich browser notifications for:

- 🏆 Tournament completions (with winner status)
- 🎯 Peer competition results
- 💰 Prize winnings (with balance updates)

The notifications include action buttons, proper icons, and smart navigation to relevant pages in your app.
